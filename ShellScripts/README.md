# Shell Scripting Concepts

Welcome to my collection of Shell Scripts! This repository is designed to demonstrate key concepts of shell scripting (Bash). Each script focuses on a specific programming concept to help understand how automation and logic work in a Linux environment.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The scripts are located in the `ShellSripts` directory and cover the following core concepts:

| Concept | File Name | Description |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| **01. Basics** | `01_hello.sh` | Introduction to printing output (`echo`) and basic execution. |
| **02. Variables** | `02_variables.sh` | How to declare, use, and store data in variables. |
| **03. User Input** | `03_read_input.sh` | Taking dynamic input from the user using `read`. |
| **04. Arithmetic** | `04_math.sh` | Performing mathematical calculations (`expr`, `$(( ))`). |
| **05. Conditionals** | `05_if_else.sh` | Decision making using `if`, `else`, and `elif`. |
| **06. Logical Operators** | `06_operators.sh` | Using AND (`&&`), OR (`||`) logic in scripts. |
| **07. Case Statements** | `07_case.sh` | Handling multiple choices cleanly (Switch-Case alternative). |
| **08. Loops (For)** | `08_for_loop.sh` | Iterating over lists, numbers, or files. |
| **09. Loops (While)** | `09_while_loop.sh` | Running code repeatedly while a condition is true. |
| **10. Arrays** | `10_arrays.sh` | Storing and accessing multiple values in a single variable. |
| **11. Functions** | `11_functions.sh` | Creating reusable blocks of code. |
| **12. File Operations** | `12_file_check.sh` | Checking if files exist, are readable, or writable. |
